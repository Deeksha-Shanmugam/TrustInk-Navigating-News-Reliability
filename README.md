In my Fake News Detection project, I started by loading the dataset using Pandas and delved into its characteristics through exploratory data analysis. 
For data preprocessing, I cleaned and processed the text data, addressing punctuation and missing values. 
Visualizations, including count plots, provided insights into the distribution of fake and genuine news.
Moving on to model implementation, I chose three machine learning models: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Passive Aggressive Classifier. 
The text data was converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. 
I trained each model on the TF-IDF vectorized training data and evaluated their performance on the test set.
Results showed that Decision Tree achieved 80% accuracy, Random Forest 90%, and Passive Aggressive Classifier 92%. 
I highlighted the interpretability of Decision Tree, the ensemble nature of Random Forest, and the adaptability of Passive Aggressive Classifier.
To provide a visual summary, I created a bar plot comparing the accuracy scores of the three models. 
In terms of alternatives, I discussed the potential of exploring other machine learning models and techniques.
For future steps, I suggested considerations such as hyperparameter tuning and trying advanced models like neural networks. 
This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, text vectorization, model selection, and performance evaluation for fake news detection.
